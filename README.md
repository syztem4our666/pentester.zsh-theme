## Overview

`pentester.zsh-theme` is a custom theme designed to display network and target IP directly in your terminal prompt. This theme is particularly useful for network security professionals, penetration testers, or anyone who needs quick access to VPN and active IP information.

## Features

- **VPN IP**: Shows the VPN IP address if connected.
- **Active IP**: Displays the active IP address of your system.
- **Target IP**: Displays a predefined target IP address if set.
- **Color-coded Prompt**: Provides a clear and colorful terminal prompt for better readability.

## Installation

To install the `pentester.zsh-theme`, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the repository that contains the theme using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/syztem4our666/pentester.zsh-theme.git
   ```

2. **Copy the Theme File**

   After cloning, copy the `pentester.zsh-theme` file to your Oh My Zsh themes directory:

    ```bash
   cd pentester.zsh-theme
   ```

   ```bash
   cp pentester.zsh-theme ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/
   ```

4. **Configure Your `.zshrc`**

   Set the theme to `pentester` in your `.zshrc` file. Open your `.zshrc` in a text editor and update the `ZSH_THEME` line:

   ```bash
   ZSH_THEME="pentester"
   ```

5. **Reload Zsh Configuration**

   Apply the changes by reloading your Zsh configuration:

   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

## Functions

### Setting the Target IP

To set the target IP address that the theme will display, create a file `~/.target_ip` with the target IP address:

```bash
echo "10.10.17.89" > ~/.target_ip
```

### Using an Alias for Convenience

For easier management of the target IP, you can create an alias to quickly set or update the target IP address. Add the following alias to your `.zshrc` file:

```bash
alias target='function _target() { echo "$1" > ~/.target_ip; }; _target'
```

With this alias, you can set the target IP address like this:

```bash
target 10.10.17.89
```
This will automatically update the `~/.target_ip` file with the new IP address and the prompt with actual target IP.
